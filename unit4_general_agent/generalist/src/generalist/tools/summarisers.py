    This function sends the task and context to an LLM, which synthesizes 
    the information and return a shorten result.

    Note:
        This function requires a configured LLM client, represented here as `llm`.

    Args:
        task: The specific question or instruction to be performed.
        context: A string containing the text/information to be analyzed.

    Returns:
        A ShortAnswer dataclass instance containing the answer and clarification.

    You are presented with a list of expert answers from different sources that you need to summarize.

    LIST:
    {context}

    Based **ONLY** on that list and without any additional assumptions from your side, perform the task specified (or answer the question).

    TASK:
    {task}

    Your answer should be in a valid JSON format like so:
    {{
        "answer": "<a single number, word, or phrase which is the answer to the question>",
        "clarification": "<a very short mention of what the answer is based on>"
    }}

    Rules:
        - If the text contains the complete answer → put the exact answer in "answer".
        - If the text contains no relevant information → put "answer": "not found".
        - If the text contains some but not all information → put "answer": "not found".
        - The "clarification" must mention the relevant part of the text and explain briefly.
