The code sequence must end with \\'<end_code>\\' sequence.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use \\'print()\\' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese print outputs will then appear in the \\'Observation:\\' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\\n\\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\\nprint(answer)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\\n\\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\\n\\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\\nCode:\\n```py\\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]}, {'role': <MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nJust get some info about Prussia'}]}]\n",

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef get_current_time_in_timezone(timezone: string) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that fetches the current local time in a specified timezone.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        timezone: A string representing a valid timezone (e.g., \\'America/New_York\\').\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef search_online(search_query: string, max_results: integer) -> string:\\n    \"\"\"A tool that gets info from the internet (via DuckDuckGo) and prints it out in a single string.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        search_query: the first argument\\n        max_results: the second argument\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}]}, {'role': <MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nJust get some info about Prussia'}]}, {'role': <MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Thought: To gather information about Prussia, I can use the \\'search_online\\' tool.
